Compiled using make file on putty servers

To run: ensure screen is roughly 500px by 700 px in dimensions

If running for the first time, type 'make' and the source files will compile.
To run the game simply type "./Main" (without quotation marks)

Note: valgrind spewed up major memory leaks, was able to get them down by aboout 50%. For the remaining leaks, was a little worried about tampering with the code to causing pointers to misfire.
