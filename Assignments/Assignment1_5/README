#README

The game is preferably played in full screen.
The board is a horizontal representation of the mountain from an aerial point of view.
To play the game cd into the directory of where the source files have been saved.
If running for the first time, type 'make' and the source files will compile.
To run the game simply type "./Main" (without quotation marks)
The game will simulate the race, the x values represent climbing the mountain vertically.
Whereas the y values represent side stepping on the mountain
